# League of Legends Match Analysis

This project is a comprehensive analysis of League of Legends (LoL) match data. The analysis focuses on the relationship between in-game objectives and match outcomes, leveraging statistical methods and machine learning models to predict match results.

## Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Includes steps to handle missing data, filtering relevant columns, and grouping data by team and match.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Univariate, Bivariate, and Aggregate analysis to uncover relationships between objectives and match outcomes.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical testing to determine the significance of various objectives in match outcomes.
- **Modeling**: Baseline and final models built to predict match outcomes based on objectives.
- **Fairness Analysis**: Evaluation of model performance across different groups to ensure fairness.

## Website Setup
- The website is live at: [Your GitHub Pages URL]
- The theme used for the site is specified in the `_config.yml` file.

## Data Analysis

### Univariate Analysis
- **Objective Distribution**: Histograms show the frequency of securing objectives, highlighting their importance in matches.

### Bivariate Analysis
- **Objective vs. Outcome**: Correlation matrices reveal which objectives are strongly associated with winning.
